# Quantum Toy Piano

The Quantum Toy Piano application enables a user to compose music that is performed by a quantum computer. The musical composition consists of a series of quantum circuits. Each note in the *performance* of a composition is a quantum state, which when measured results in a pitch determined by quantum mechanical behavior. This normally results in unique melodies and harmonies each time a given composition is performed by the quantum computer. Fig. 1 contains the music score captured from one such performance.

FIG. 1. Music score captured from performance of a quantum musical composition

To create a quantum musical composition, the user first supplies the desired probabilities for a given pitch to follow another given pitch melodically. Take a moment to examine the music score in Fig. 1 and notice that the staff labeled **Melody** contains an eight-note melody, and realize that the staff labeled **Harmony** actually contains seven four-note melodies.  These probabilities are entered by the user into the doubly-stochastic matrix located on the left side of the MELODY MATRICES tab, shown in Fig 2.
